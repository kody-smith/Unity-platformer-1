# Unity-platformer

# Overview

This is a Unity @d Platformer written in C#. 
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the tools in Unity to develop more games in the future, 
as well as improving my overall knowledge as a software developer.

This game is a side-scrolling platformer comparable to the likes of Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog.

Below is a demo of the software with some explanations.
